# Minesweeper - stage 4

## View

- Add to your program a class used to display the board in text mode,
- It should show the game from the player's view,
- This class should receive a reference to the board class in its' constructor,
- The display could look like this:
```
   0  1  2  3  4
0 [_][F][_][_][F]
1 [_][_][F][_][_]
2 [F][_][_][_][_]
3 [_][_][_][_][_]
4 [_][F][_][_][_]
```

Dividing the view from the board class might seem strange,
but supposedly it is a good practice to keep different game functionalities: logic and displaying
in two diffrent classes, because it will make much easier for us, to reuse game logic in the GUI app.
This obviously is true in the spirit of polymorphism.

## Controlling

Develop your game to be a fully functional console app.
- Add a class used to control the game,
- At the beggining the player should choose the size of the board and the difficulty,
- Implement the `play` method, which handles the interaction between the player and the board.

There is also a proposal of how the main function should look like at this point.
Please do not take this seriously as it hurts my eyes a little.
```
int main() 
{ 
  MinesweeperBoard board (20, 10, GameMode::EASY); 
  MSBoardTextView view ( board ); 
  MSTextController ctrl ( board, view );

  ctrl.play();  
}
```
