# Minesweeper - stage 2

## Debug display

Create a const qualified function:
`void debug_display() const`
which will display the state of every cell on the board.
Each field should contain three characters inside `[]` brackets:
1. First character - mine status:
  - If true `M`,
  - If false `.`;
2. Second character - reveal status:
  - If true `r`,
  - If false `.`;
3. Third character - flag status:
  - If true `f`,
  - If false `.`;

All columns and rows should be numbered, the output should look like this:
```
    0    1    2    3    4
0 [M..][...][M.f][...][...]
1 [...][.r.][...][...][...]
2 [...][...][...][...][...]
3 [...][...][...][...][...]
4 [...][...][...][...][...]
5 [...][...][...][...][...]
6 [...][...][...][...][...]
```

## Adding difficulty levels

Create an enum representing game modes, with values:
- EASY,
- NORMAL,
- HARD,
- DEBUG.

## Parametric constructor

Create a parametric constructor taking following arguments:
- width,
- height,
- gamemode.

This constructor should:
- Set the width and height to the specified values,
- Place mines on the board in the following fashion:
  1. EASY: number of mines equal to 10% of the board area,
  2. NORMAL: number of mines equal to 20% of the board area,
  3. HARD: number of mines equal to 30% of the board area,
  4. DEBUG:
     - all fields in the first row should have a mine,
     - all fields on the top-left to bottom-right should have a mine,
     - every second field in the first column should have a mine.

NOTE:
- If the number of mines needs to get rounded, always round up,
- Don't place mines into fields already containing them.
