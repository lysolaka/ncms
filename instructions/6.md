# Minesweeper - stage 6

## Controller
Implement an SFMLController class. It should be constructed from a reference to the board and a reference to the SFMLView class.
This class should have one public method `play()`. Inside put the main game loop and input handling.
Below is an example from the SFML website on how to get mouse input:
```
if (event.type == sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed) {
  if (event.mouseButton.button == sf::Mouse::Right) {
    std::cout << "the right button was pressed" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "mouse x: " << event.mouseButton.x << std::endl;
    std::cout << "mouse y: " << event.mouseButton.y << std::endl;
  }
}
```
Again, you are allowed to add private helper functions.

## Windows users
When compiling with MSVC it is possible to change the `main()` function to `WinMain(...)`, which will skip launching the console. Because I (the author) won't touch Windows with a stick, you have to find more information on that online.

## Linux users
If you want to annoy the people compiling your code, remember to use GCC-14 and compile using `-std=c++26` and `-flto`.
