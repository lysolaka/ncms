# Minesweeper - stage 3

## Simple getters

Introduce new methods to the board class:
- const qualified `get_width()`,
- const qualified `get_height()`,
- const qualified `get_mines()`, which returns the number of mines left on the field.

## Utility

Introduce a new field storing the value of `game_state`:
- `game_state` should be an enum with following possible keys:
  1. `RUNNING`,
  2. `FINISHED_WIN`,
  3. `FINISHED_LOSS`.


Introduce new methods to the board class:
1. const qualified `count_mines(row, column)`, which returns the number of mines around the specified field according to minesweeper rules,
2. const qualified `has_flag(row, column)`, which returns the state of the flag in the specified field,
3. const qualified `is_revealed(row, column)`, which returns the revealed state of the specified field.
4. const qualified `get_game_state()`, which returns the value of game state.
5. const qualified `char get_field_info(row, column)`, which:
   - if the specified position is outside the board returns `'#'`,
   - if the field is not revealed and has a flag returns `'F'`,
   - if the field is not revealed and does not have a flag returns `'_'`,
   - if the field is revealed and has a mine returns `'x'`,
   - if the field is revealed and has zero mines around returns `' ' (ASCII 0x20)`,
   - if the field is revealed and has mines around it returns the number of mines as an ASCII code (`'1'` to `'8'`).


## Gameplay functions

1. `toggle_flag(row, column)`, which toggles the flag state at the specified field,
2. `reveal_field(row, column)`, which attempts to reveal a field at the specified position:
   - Does nothing if any of the following is true:
     1. field was already revealed,
     2. the position is outside the board,
     3. game is already finished,
     4. the field has a flag.
   - If the field is clear (has no mine): reveal it,
   - If the field has a mine on it:
     1. If it's the player's first action:
        - reveal it and move the mine somewhere else,
        - don't do that in debug mode.
     2. If it's not the first action:
        - reveal it and finish the game with a loss condition.
