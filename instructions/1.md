# Minesweeper - stage 1

Your project should be created with programming good techniques with proper naming of variables and dividing the code into files.

## Basic storage class

Create a class representing the board of the game, store:
- Size of the board
- State of each field, whether it:
  1. is revealed,
  2. contains a mine,
  3. has a flag.

Create a nonparametric constructor, which:
- Sets the height and width of the board to some reasonably small number
- Set initial values to every field:
  1. not revealed,
  2. not containing a mine,
  3. isn't flagged;
- Sets fields:
  1. Row [0], Column [0]: mine, no flag, not revealed,
  2. Row [1], Column [1]: no mine, no flag, revealed,
  3. Row [0], Column [2]: mine, flag, not revealed.
