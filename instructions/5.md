## SFML

Install the SFML library.
- Windows - choose your version from the website below:
```
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.1/
```
- Arch GNU/Linux:

## View class
Add a SFMLView class. It should get a reference to the board as a constructor argument. It is recommended to use a struct for storing available assets.
The class should have one public method `void display() const`, which displays the current frame (state of the board).
You are of course allowed to add private helper functions.
